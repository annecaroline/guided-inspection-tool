# Guided Inspection Tool #

In a software development process, artifacts from a stage are used as input to create new artifacts on another. The transition between different artifacts may not be precise; inconsistencies may occur. These inconsistent artifacts may produce software with defects. In this context, a software inspection technique is needed to validate these artifacts. This project presents a method to automate a guided inspection technique, which evaluates the conformity between artifacts of distinct abstraction levels. The inspection uses test cases, that represent each use case scenario of the requirement specification. Since test case steps have the system behavior, so the guided inspection allows to detect semantic defects. Moreover, how it’s an automated techinique it’s also possible to detect inconsistences about the artefact syntaxes. As support for the automation, we are using MDA (Model Driven Architecture) to perform model-to-model transformations and the USE tool for model simulation.
