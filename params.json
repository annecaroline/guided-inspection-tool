The transition between different artifacts may not be precise; inconsistencies may occur. These inconsistent artifacts may produce software with defects. In this context, a software inspection technique is needed to validate these artifacts. This project presents a method to automate a guided inspection technique, which evaluates the conformity between artifacts of distinct abstraction levels. The inspection uses test cases, that represent each use case scenario of the requirement specification. Since test case steps have the system behavior, so the guided inspection allows to detect semantic defects. Moreover, how it’s an automated techinique it’s also possible to detect inconsistences about the artefact syntaxes. As support for the automation, we are using MDA (Model Driven Architecture) to perform model-to-model transformations and the USE tool for model simulation.\r\n\r\n## Informations \r\n\r\n* About the [USE Tool 2.4.0](http://www.db.informatik.uni-bremen.de/projects/use-2.4.0.zip)\r\n* The Eclipse IDE to run the Guided Inspection Tool must have the development ATL enviroment.\r\n* You will need some knowledge about Action Semantic, ATL and MDA.\r\n* Magic Draw 16.5\r\n\r\n### Labels:   \r\n    \r\n* UML\r\n* Sequence Diagram\r\n* Action Semantic\r\n* ATL\r\n* Software Inspection\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
